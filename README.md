## Dataset Used
[International Football Results (1872–2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=results.csv)

The link is dated 2017, unlike the one written by this dataset, as at its creation the dataset contained records from 1872 to 2017. It has subsequently always been updated monthly by adding new matches but the link has always remained the same.
